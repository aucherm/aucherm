## Who am I ?


- 👋🏾 Hi, ma name is Maëlle Aucher
- 📍 I'm living in Nantes, France
- 🏫 I have a Master in English and Spanish Translation and a Master MEEF (to become a teacher)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development at ADATECH School
- 🗣️ French is my mother tongue but I speak English fluently. I speak Spanish too.
- 🧶 In my free time I enjoy knitting, reading, seeing my friends, travelling and cuddling with my dog, Sparrow
- ⚡ Fun fact : I'm afraid of pigeons and I could eat ice cream every day
